# Hospital-Management-System-Using-Java-Swing

HOSPITALMGTGUI is a hospital management system developed in Java that aims to streamline and automate key operations within a hospital setting. The system provides a user-friendly graphical interface built using Java Swing, enabling hospital staff to manage essential data like doctor details, patient records, billing, and staff information.

# Key Features:
- Interactive UI: A simple and intuitive interface for navigating through various hospital modules such as Doctors, Patients, Billing, and more.
- Dynamic Data Management: Allows users to add, edit, delete, and search hospital records with ease.
- Modular Architecture: Clear separation of different modules for easy extension and future modifications.
- In-memory Data Management: Data is temporarily stored in memory for the duration of the session. Future work includes integrating a database for data persistence.

# Technologies Used:
- Java: Core programming language used for system development.
- Java Swing: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- JTable, JTextField, JButton: Key UI components used for dynamic interactions.
- TableRowSorter: For sorting and filtering data dynamically in tables.
- JOptionPane: For displaying user-friendly dialog boxes for interactions (e.g., errors, confirmations).

# Future Work:
- Database Integration: Implementing persistent data storage using a database for better data management and long-term usage.
- Scalability: Enhancing the system to handle larger amounts of data and more complex hospital operations.
- Improved Error Handling: Adding better validation and feedback mechanisms to improve user experience.
